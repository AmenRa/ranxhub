			<h3>Speed-up Research</h3>
			<p>
				Have you ever gotten stuck trying to run, implement, or reproduce baseline results? <br /> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> allows you to focus on your research without wasting time and energy implementing, training, and running the baselines you choose for your comparative evaluation.
			</p>

			<h3>Transparency</h3>
			<p>
				Would you like scientific research to be more transparent? <br /> Take the initiative, <a href="mailto:ranxhub@gmail.com">send us</a> pre-computed runs from your scientific publications, and lead by example!
			</p>

			<h3>Climate Change</h3>
			<p>
				Today, Computer Science research has a significant <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf%22%3EWachstum">environmental impact</a> due to the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by training Machine learning models. Using <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a>'s pre-computed baselines, you can reduce electricity consumption and pollution resulting from your research activities!
			</p>

			<h3>Metasearch</h3>
			<p>
				Would you like to verify the potential of the combination of your model with other models at the state-of-the-art? <br /> Take advantage of the <a href="https://amenra.github.io/ranx/fusion/">fusion functionalities</a> provided by <a href="https://github.com/AmenRa/ranx">ranx</a> and try all the combinations you desire!
			</p>

			<h3>Meta-Analysis</h3>
			<p>
				Are you as curious as I am to conduct meta-analyses on new modeling trends to learn more about the similarities and differences between the new models? <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> is right for you!
			</p>

			<h3>Reproducibility</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> gives you access to the original runs from research papers, allowing you to compare the query-document-score triplets produced by your implementation of the system you are trying to reproduce and those from the original authors: much better than comparing mere averaged metric scores!
			</p>

			<h3>Peer Review</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> can help you to check state-of-the-art claims and the appropriateness of the baseline choices of the research paper you are reviewing.
