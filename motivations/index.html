			<h3>Speed-up Research</h3>
			<p>Have you ever gotten stuck trying to run, implement, or reproduce baseline results? <br /> <a
					href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> allows
				you to focus on your research without wasting time and energy
				implementing,
				training, and
				running
				the baselines you choose for your comparative evaluation.</p>

			<h3>Transparency</h3>
			<p>Would you like scientific research to be more transparent? <br /> Take the initiative, <a
					href="mailto:ranxhub@gmail.com">send us</a>
				pre-computed runs from
				your scientific publications, and lead by example!</p>

			<h3>Climate Change</h3>
			<p>Today, Computer Science research has a significant <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf%22%3EWachstum">environmental impact</a> due to the CO2 produced by training Machine learning models. Using <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a>'s pre-computed baselines, you can reduce electricity consumption and pollution resulting from your research activities!</p>

			<h3>Metasearch</h3>
			<p>Would you like to verify the potential of the combination of your model with other models at the
				state-of-the-art? <br /> Take advantage of the <a href="https://amenra.github.io/ranx/fusion/">fusion
					functionalities</a> provided by <a href="https://github.com/AmenRa/ranx">ranx</a> and try all the
				combinations you desire!
			</p>

			<h3>Meta-Analysis</h3>
			<p>Are you as curious as I am to conduct meta-analyses on new modeling trends to learn more about the
				similarities
				and differences between the new models?<br /> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> is right for you!
			</p>

			<h3>Reproducibility</h3>
			<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> gives you access to the original runs from research papers,
				allowing you to compare the
				query-document-score triplets produced by your implementation of the system you are trying to
				reproduce and those from the original authors: much better than comparing mere averaged metric
				scores!</p>

			<h3>Peer Review</h3>
			<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">RanxHub</a> can help you to check state-of-the-art claims and the
				appropriateness of the baseline choices
				of the research paper you are reviewing.</p>
